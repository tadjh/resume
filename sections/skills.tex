Skilled in building end-to-end social content workflows: rapid editing, thumbnail/key art creation, platform-ready exports, and consistent brand execution across formats. Brings a strong technical foundation (web + automation) that supports scalable content operations, efficient asset management, and data-informed iteration on creative performance.}

\Skill{Self-Motivated}{Self-directed builder who independently learns and applies new technologies, defines structure in ambiguous problems, and ships incrementally with long-term maintainability in mind. Proven through multi-year self-initiated work, including sustained freelance practice, production tools, and internally used platforms.}

\Skill{Problem Solver}{Reliability-focused problem solver who isolates root causes, makes clear architectural tradeoffs, and refactors systems for long-term stability. Emphasizes guardrails, observability, and automation to prevent recurring failures rather than treating symptoms.}

\Skill{Strong Work Ethic}{Brings disciplined and focused effort to harden systems and reach durable outcomes. Balances speed with thoroughness and continues shipping and maintaining projects even without external pressure.}

\Skill{Organized}{Maintains clear, well-structured systems through consistent naming, strong boundaries, and documentation, using organization to reduce miscommunication, speed onboarding, and keep projects maintainable as they scale.}
